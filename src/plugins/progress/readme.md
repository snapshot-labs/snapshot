# Progress

## Keep Track of [Snapshot.org](http://Snapshot.org) Proposal Progress

Progress is a small and simple plugin for [Snapshot.org](http://Snapshot.org) that allows Spaces to inform DAO members the progress of a proposal _after_ voting has completed - how a proposal is progressing in being executed. Often, finding this information requires monitoring notificatiosn on Discord, Telegram, and Twitter - what if we could just check back right at the source of the proposal on Snapshot? Yes please.

## Features
* Creation of New Steps
* Marking of steps as 'Completed'
* Deletion of Steps (Only allowed for steps yet to be 'Completed')
* Web3 Signature Authetication

## Who can add, complete, and delete steps?
Only a Proposals Author is able to view the Edit button, which displays options to do the following:
- Create new Steps
- Mark Steps as 'Complete'
